### `-convert-layout-to-physical`: Convert spatial with physical layout to physical dialect
This pass analyzes 'layout.device' and the nested placed and routed
elements on physical slots, lowers the elements in the specified device to
the physical dialect.

#### Options
```
-device : The device to be lowered
```
### `-convert-nop`: No operation
This pass does nothing.  It simply relies on all dialects and is used to
keep building in case no other conversion has its dependency satisfied.
