# 'physical' Dialect

This dialect describes the actual physical implementation of the spatial
architecture. It abstracted out the most common low-level features provided
by the devices and platforms.  The layout information is embedded into the
node as device-specific attributes.

The physical operations used in a valid code must be non-overlapping with
others and has a specific physical location.  For sharing of a resource,
a shared version is implemented depending on device support, and only one
shared operation is specified in the code.

The dialect acts as the assembly for physical designs.  The mapping from
this dialect to either code generator (mlir-translate), or the lower level
dialects must be one-to-one.  Depending on the device and platform, some
operations defined might not be supported.

## Operation definition

### `physical.buffer` (::phy::physical::BufferOp)

buffer creation operation


Syntax:

```
operation ::= `physical.buffer` `(` `)` attr-dict `:` type($buffer)
```

The `physical.buffer` operation represents a creation of a buffer that has
the type argument as its datatype.  A buffer is a memory space that stores
data.  A buffer can be randomly accessed.  It can have a device-specific
attribute of location.

Example:

```mlir
%buffer = physical.buffer() : memref<1024xi32>
```

### `physical.bus_cache` (::phy::physical::BusCacheOp)

creation of a cache layer between two addressed buses


Syntax:

```
operation ::= `physical.bus_cache` `(` $upstream `,` $downstream `)` attr-dict `:` type($bus_cache)
```

An operation creating a cache to connect two buses.  With the bus cache,
the memory access on the 'downstream' bus from the buffers on the 'upstream'
bus will be cached, and the 'downstream' bus is able to receive data from
the buffers on the 'upstream' bus.  The 'physical.bus_cache' type specifies
the number of elements that can be cached.

Example:

```mlir
%bus1 = physical.bus() : !physical.bus<i32>
%bus2 = physical.bus() : !physical.bus<i32>
%cache = physical.bus_cache(%bus1, %bus2) : !physical.bus_cache<i32, 1024>
```

#### Operands:

              `:` type($buffer) `)` attr-dict
```

An operation that maps the 'buffer' starting the 'offset'-th element,
into the 'bus'.  The mapped address is from 'begin'-th element
(inclusive), to the 'end'-th element (exclusive) on the bus.

              ( `,` $next^ )?
              `)` regions attr-dict
```

`physical.stream_dma_connect` connects a buffer to/from the stream endpoint
and when the data transfer in this connection is completed, the next
connection as specified in `next` will be established.  If the `next` is
not specified, the DMA engine will be terminated when the current
connection is completed.

In each connection, the `buffer` is specified with the `start` point,
inclusively, and the `end` point, exclusively.  The data from the
buffer/stream will be transferred to the stream/buffer, and the lock will
be acquired from the `acquire` state before the transfer is performed, and
released to the `release` state when the transfer is done.

A connection can have an optional `tag` attribute.  When the `tag` is
specified, an output connection will have the stream data tagged with
`tag`.  For input connections, the `tag` will be ignored and all data
received from the stream will be part of the connection.

Example:

```mlir
%0 = physical.stream_dma_connect<1>(
  %lock[0->1], %buffer[0:1024]: memref<1024xi32>, %0)
}

Syntax:

```
operation ::= `physical.stream_dma` `(` $endpoint `:` type($endpoint) `)` regions attr-dict
```

An operation creating a stream dma engines that is connected to a stream
endpoint.  If the endpoint is an istream, then the stream's data is written
to the buffers sequentially according to the order as specified in the
`physical.stream_dma_connect` operation.  Otherwise, if the endpoint is an
ostream, the buffers are read from instead.  Depending on the target, one
or multiple `physical.stream_dma_connect` operations are supported in a
single `physical.stream_dma` region.  The first connection in the region is
established first, and the next connection as specified in the operation is
established next, so on and so forth.

Example:

```mlir
physical.stream_dma(%endpoint: !physical.istream<i32>) {
  %0 = physical.stream_dma_connect(
    %lock1[0->1], %buffer1[0:1024]: memref<1024xi32>, %1)
  %1 = physical.stream_dma_connect(
    %lock2[0->1], %buffer2[0:1024]: memref<1024xi32>, %0)

Syntax:

```
operation ::= `physical.stream_hub` `(` $endpoints `)` attr-dict `:` functional-type($endpoints, $stream_hub)
```

An operation creating a stream hub to connect multiple streams.  A stream
reads data from all `phy.istream` endpoints, and broadcast data to all
`phy.ostream` endpoints.  Depending on the target, one or multiple input
or output endpoints are supported.  Depending on the target, multicasting
using data tags may be supported and only streams observing the tag of a
piece of data will receive the data.

Example:

```mlir
%stream_hub = physical.stream_hub(%src1, %src2, %dest1, %dest2)
        : (!physical.istream<i32>,  !physical.istream<i32>,
           !physical.ostream<i32>, !physical.ostream<i32>)

```
operation ::= `physical.stream` (`<` $tags^ `>`)? `(` `)` attr-dict
              `:` `(` type($ostream) `,` type($istream) `)`
```

The `physical.stream` operation represents a creation of a stream that
connects two endpoints and provides a streaming connection.  The created
stream can be connected as an operand in `physical.core` operations for the
software function to access and communicate, or by a `physical.stream_dma`
operation.  Streams can be connected using `physical.stream_hub`s.  A
stream can optionally observe tagged data, and the observed tags shall be
specified as the `tags` attribute.  Data's tag will be preseved when
passing from the ostream endpoint to the istream endpoint.

Example:

```mlir
%stream:2 = physical.stream<[0,1]>()
          : (!physical.ostream<i32>, !physical.istream<i32>)
// %stream#0 is the ostream, and %stream#1 is the istream
